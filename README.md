# Orca1
Polyphonic subtractive soft-synth built on the wonderful IPlug2 framework.

This is early days of a first iPlug2 project and certainly shouldnt be taken as an example of how to do anything.

## TODO

* use of midi message timestamps for sub-frame level timing
* fix builds for anything other than vst3
